## About
Numvisz is a program that lets you make animated visualizations of data. The program is written in C++ and utilizes Qt for the GUI, and OpenGL for the visualization.

## Structure
The project has 2 CMake targets, the barchart executable, and the picker executable. The picker is the GUI tool, which launches the barchart executable with the necessary command line arguments. The root CMakeLists configures the exeuctables to be placed next to eachother in a bin directory within the build directory, so that the picker can find the barchart executable.

## Compiling
The dependencies of the program include Qt (Core, Widgets, Sql), GLFW and Freetype, along with their respective dependencies.

Note the instructions below assume you have an installation of the Qt SDK on your system, containing the libraries and headers required for compilation.
You could alternatively add Qt as a dependency under the vcpkg manifest - make sure you specify which features you require though, otherwise you can end up compiling everything (which will take a long time!)
### Windows
For Windows, its recommended you compile with vcpkg for GLFW and Freetype, and direct CMake to an installation of Qt.
Note you most likely will need the Windows SDK.

Below is a set of sample commands you can run to generate a build directory and compile:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<your path to Qt e.g: C:\Qt\6.7.2\msvc2019_64> -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
Alternatively, you can open the project in an IDE like QT creator which already has vcpkg integration. Visual Studio should also work provided you tell it where to find Qt either through the extension or manually.

To run the picker executable (the GUI) you will need <your path to Qt\bin e.g: C:\Qt\6.7.2\msvc2019_64\bin> in your path or it will complain that it can't find the executable. Qt Creator automatically does this for you. You can also run windeployqt which will place the dlls next to the exe, although this tool is more for deployment.

### Linux
Most distributions should have the listed dependencies in the system's repositories.
Use your system's package management tool to install the dependencies listed above and then the commands below should work.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

You can alternatively use vcpkg.
